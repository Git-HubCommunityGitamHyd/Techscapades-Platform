## 🔄 Changes from Current Implementation

### Current vs New Approach

| Aspect | Current | New |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Team Creation | Auto-generated by admin | Admin manually adds team names (from Google Forms) |
| Team Password | Auto-generated, given to teams | Set by teams themselves during registration |
| Team Size | Not enforced | Min/Max players enforced (default: 2) |
| Hints | Location hint always visible | Timed hints that appear after X minutes |
| Timer | Per-event countdown | Global timer that starts when admin clicks "Start" |
| Scoring | +10 per scan | Multiple scoring options (discussed below) |
| Fake QRs | Not supported | Meme/Rickroll QRs that redirect to links |

## 📋 Implementation Items

### 1. Manual Team Registration with Player Limits

**Context:** Teams register via Google Forms. Admin gets team names and manually adds them to the platform.

**Changes Required:**

#### Admin Side
- [ ] Remove "Bulk Generate Teams" functionality
- [ ] Add "Create Team" form with fields:
  - Team Name (from Google Forms)
  - Min Players (default: 2)
  - Max Players (default: 2)
- [ ] Event-level settings for default min/max players

#### Database Changes
- [ ] Add to `teams` table:
  ```sql
  min_players INTEGER DEFAULT 2,
  max_players INTEGER DEFAULT 2
  ```
- [ ] Create new `team_members` table to track individual players:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE team_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- For login
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

#### Player Side
- [ ] Team registration/join flow where players enter:
  - Team Name (dropdown - must match existing)
  - Player Name
  - Username (they choose)
  - Password (they set it)
  - Confirm Password
- [ ] Enforce: Cannot join if team already has `max_players` members
- [ ] Login uses `team_members` table instead of `teams` table

**✅ DECIDED:**
- Each player has their **own individual password**
- Requires `team_members` table (more complex but better UX)
- Admin can see who joined each team
- Consider: Is Supabase Auth worth the complexity? (TBD - prioritize UX)

```

#### Registration Page (`/register`)
- [ ] Create new route `/register`
- [ ] Form fields:
  - Event dropdown (if multiple events)
  - Team dropdown (filtered by event, shows only teams with room)
  - Player Name
  - Username (must be unique)
  - Password
  - Confirm Password
- [ ] Validation:
  - Team has room (current members < max_players)
  - Username is unique globally
  - Password matches confirm
- [ ] On successful registration:
  - Insert into `team_members` table
  - Redirect to `/login` with success message

#### Login Page (`/login`)
- [ ] Update to query `team_members` table instead of `teams`
- [ ] Return combined data:
  ```javascript
  {
    player: { id, player_name, username },
    team: { id, team_name, score, current_step, ... }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Store both in localStorage for session

#### API Endpoints
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/register` - Player registration
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/login` - Player login (updated)
- [ ] `GET /api/teams/available` - Get teams with room for event

---

### 1.2 Admin Player Management

**Context:** Admins need to manage players (view who registered, move between teams if wrong selection)

#### Admin Teams Page Updates
- [ ] Show registered players under each team:
  ```
  Team: The Coders (2/2 players)
  ├── Harsha (@harsha_dev)      [Move] [Remove]
  └── Ravi (@ravi123)           [Move] [Remove]
  ```
- [ ] "Move Player" functionality:
  - Select player
  - Choose new team from dropdown
  - Validate new team has room
  - Update `team_members.team_id`
- [ ] "Remove Player" functionality:
  - Delete from `team_members`
  - Player must re-register

#### API Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /api/admin/players?event_id=xxx` - Get all players for event
- [ ] `PUT /api/admin/players/:id/move` - Move player to different team
- [ ] `DELETE /api/admin/players/:id` - Remove player from team

#### Database Considerations
- Moving a player mid-game:
  - What happens to their hint progress? (Reset or keep?)
  - What happens to scans they made? (Keep for now)
  - Recommended: Only allow moves before hunt starts

---

### 2. Timed Hint System

**Context:** Teams first see only the riddle. After a configurable time, a "Show Hint" button appears.

**Changes Required:**

#### Admin Side (Event Settings)
- [ ] Add to event settings:
  - `hint_delay_minutes` - Global time before hints become available

#### Admin Side (Clue Management)
- [ ] Add to clue form:
  - `hint_text` - The hint to show (separate from riddle)

**✅ DECIDED:** Hint delay is a **global setting** at event level (not per-clue)

#### Database Changes
- [ ] Add to `events` table:
  ```sql
  hint_delay_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 5  -- Global for all clues
  ```
- [ ] Add to `clues` table:
  ```sql
  hint_text TEXT
  ```
- [ ] Add to `team_clue_order` or new table:
  ```sql
  clue_started_at TIMESTAMPTZ,  -- When team first saw this clue
  hint_viewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  hint_viewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
  ```

#### Player Side (Hunt Page)
- [ ] Show riddle immediately
- [ ] Start timer when clue is first displayed
- [ ] After `hint_delay_minutes`, show "Show Hint" button
- [ ] When clicked:
  - Record that hint was viewed
  - Apply point deduction (based on scoring system)
  - Display the hint

**Flow:**
```
Team sees Clue → Timer starts
                    ↓
            [5 minutes pass]
                    ↓
        "Show Hint" button appears
                    ↓
    Team clicks → Hint revealed, points deducted
```

---

### 3. Global Timer with Admin Start Control

**Context:** A visible countdown timer that starts when admin clicks "Start" and is displayed to all players.

**Changes Required:**

#### Admin Side
- [ ] "Start Hunt" button on Monitor page (or Events page)
- [ ] When clicked:
  - Sets `hunt_started_at` timestamp
  - All teams can now begin

#### Database Changes
- [ ] Add to `events` table:
  ```sql
  hunt_started_at TIMESTAMPTZ,  -- NULL until admin starts
  hunt_duration_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 60  -- Total hunt time
  ```

#### Player Side
- [ ] If `hunt_started_at` is NULL → Show "Waiting for hunt to start..."
- [ ] Once started → Show countdown timer prominently
- [ ] Timer shows: `Time Remaining: 45:23`
- [ ] When timer ends → Hunt automatically stops for all teams

**Real-time Sync:**
- All players see the same timer value
- Timer is calculated from `hunt_started_at + hunt_duration_minutes`

---

### 4. Hint Viewing Restriction (Anti-Cheat)

**Context:** Prevent both team members from viewing the hint. Options:

#### Option A: Only One Can View
- [ ] Track which player viewed the hint
- [ ] If teammate tries to view, show message: "Your teammate has already viewed this hint"

#### Option B: Either Can View, Points Deducted
- [ ] Any team member can click "Show Hint"
- [ ] Points deducted from team immediately
- [ ] Both members then see the hint (synced)

**Recommended:** Option B (simpler to implement, same outcome)

**Implementation:**
- [ ] When hint is viewed, update team record
- [ ] Real-time sync to other team member's device
- [ ] Hint button disabled after first click

---

### 5. Scoring System

**Context:** Multiple scoring ideas discussed. Need to finalize.

#### Scoring Option 1: Simple + Hint Penalty
```
+10 points → Scan correct QR (without hint)
+5 points  → Scan correct QR (after viewing hint)
```

#### Scoring Option 2: Time-Based Bonus
```
Base scoring (Option 1) PLUS:
+ Speed bonus: Based on how quickly all riddles solved
+ Remaining time bonus: 0.5 points per remaining minute

Example:
  - Team finishes with 10 minutes remaining
  - Bonus: 10 × 0.5 = 5 extra points
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- [ ] Store `hint_viewed` per clue per team
- [ ] Scoring logic in `/api/scan`:
  ```javascript
  if (hintViewed) {
    newScore = team.score + 5;
  } else {
    newScore = team.score + 10;
  }
  ```
- [ ] Store `hunt_finished_at` per team to calculate time bonus

**✅ DECIDED:** Keep both scoring options documented. Final decision later.

**Questions Still Open:**
- How is "speed bonus" calculated exactly?
- Is time bonus applied only if team finishes within time limit?

---

### 6. User-Set Passwords

**Context:** Teams set their own password instead of admin-generated.

**Changes Required:**

#### Registration Flow
- [ ] Create `/register` or `/join-team` page
- [ ] Form fields:
  - Team Name (dropdown or text match)
  - Player Name
  - Password (set by user)
  - Confirm Password

**✅ DECIDED:** Each player has their **own individual password**

#### Implementation Approach
- Use `team_members` table (see Item #1)
- Each player registers separately with their own credentials
- Login authenticates against `team_members` table
- Session stores both player info AND team info

#### Auth Consideration
> **Question:** Is Supabase Auth better for this?
> - **Pros:** Secure sessions, password reset, email verification
> - **Cons:** Added complexity, might slow down UX for 20 users
> - **Decision:** TBD - prioritize simple UX for small event, can upgrade later

#### Database Changes
- [ ] Create `team_members` table (see Item #1)
- [ ] Teams created by admin have no password (just team name + limits)
- [ ] Players register and set their own passwords
- [ ] Login query joins `team_members` with `teams`

---

### 7. Meme/Fake QR Codes (Rickrolls)

**Context:** Add decoy QR codes that redirect to meme links when scanned.

**Changes Required:**

#### Admin Side
- [ ] New section: "Fake QRs" or add toggle in QR generation
- [ ] Form fields for fake QR:
  - Label (e.g., "Rickroll 1")
  - Redirect URL (e.g., `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
  - Optional: Custom message before redirect

#### Database Changes
- [ ] Add to `qr_codes` table:
  ```sql
  is_fake BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  redirect_url TEXT  -- NULL for real QRs, URL for fake ones
  ```

#### Player Side (Scan Page)
- [ ] When fake QR scanned:
  - Don't validate as clue
  - Show fun message: "Nice try! 😏" or "You got rickrolled! 🎵"
  - Redirect to the meme URL after 2-3 seconds
  - Track the victim! (see below)

**✅ DECIDED:** Track which player fell for fake QRs

#### Fake QR Tracking
- [ ] Create `fake_qr_scans` table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE fake_qr_scans (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    qr_code_id UUID REFERENCES qr_codes(id),
    team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
    player_id UUID REFERENCES team_members(id),
    scanned_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```
- [ ] Admin can view "Hall of Shame" - who fell for which fake QR
- [ ] Fun stats: "Team 3 fell for 2 rickrolls!" displayed in monitor

#### QR Generation
- [ ] Fake QRs generated with same token format but marked as fake
- [ ] Included in ZIP download (separate folder: `/fake_qrs`)

## 📝 Notes from Discussion

**Event Details:**
- 10 teams of 2 players each (20 total users)
- Google Forms used for initial team registration (external to platform)
- Previous event had physical rickroll QRs that were funny - want to digitize this

**Decisions Made (Jan 14, 2026):**
- Individual passwords per player (not shared team password)
- Need `team_members` table for player tracking
- Hint delay is global (not per-clue)
- Track fake QR victims with player name + team
- Scoring ideas kept as options, decide later
